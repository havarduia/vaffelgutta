\section{Introduction}
To attract more students to engineering, the University Of Agder wanted to obtain a product that could showcase mechatronics in a fun and engaging way. A waffle making robot was chosen as a suitable demonstration. The project focuses on automating the processes of opening/closing the iron, greasing the iron, pouring in batter and serving the finished product. Eating the waffles was not automated, leaving the job to humans. The core innovation made by this project was the inlusion of machine vision to make the system adaptable to changes in the environment.
